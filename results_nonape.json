These systems can be used to create artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning applications. Neuromorphic systems are inspired by the brain and nervous system, and can be used to create systems that are more efficient and scalable than traditional AI systems.\n\nNeuromorphic engineering has its roots in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). In the early days of AI, researchers attempted to create systems that could mimic the human brain. This was difficult, as the brain is a complex and non-linear system. However, with the advent of neural networks and other AI techniques, researchers were able to create systems that could approximate the brain's function.\n\nNeural networks are a key component of neuromorphic systems. A neural network is a collection of interconnected processing nodes, or neurons, that can learn to recognize patterns of input data. Neural networks are similar to the brain in that they are composed of a large number of interconnected processing units.\n\nNeuromorphic systems are composed of both hardware and software. The hardware consists of special purpose chips that are designed to mimic the structure and function of the brain. The software consists of algorithms that are used to train the system to perform specific tasks.\n\nNeuromorphic systems have many advantages over traditional AI systems.

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in building artificial brains, or brain-like computer systems. This paper discusses the design of such systems, specifically focusing on silicon brains in the nano-CMOS era.\n\nOne key challenge in building artificial brains is understanding how neurons work. Neurons are the basic building blocks of the brain, and they communicate with each other through electrical signals. In order to create artificial neurons that function like their biological counterparts, researchers must understand how these electrical signals are generated and how they are transmitted.\n\nAnother challenge is designing synapses, which are the connections between neurons. Synapses are responsible for transmitting electrical signals from one neuron to another, and they are also involved in learning and memory. In order to create artificial brains that can learn and remember, it is essential to design synapses that function like their biological counterparts.\n\nFinally, another challenge is designing the overall architecture of an artificial brain. The brain is a highly complex system, and designing a brain-like computer system requires careful planning and optimization.\n\nIn conclusion, the design of silicon brains in the nano-CMOS era is a challenging but exciting field of research.

This algorithm is used to find the minimum of a function by taking small steps in the direction of the negative gradient. The authors explain that this algorithm is inspired by the physical system of a ball rolling down a hill. The ball will always roll in the direction of the steepest slope, and will eventually reach the bottom of the hill.\n\nThe second algorithm discussed is the Simulated Annealing algorithm. This algorithm is used to find the global minimum of a function by starting at a random point and taking small steps in random directions. The steps are chosen such that they are more likely to lead to a lower energy state, but occasionally a higher energy state is chosen in order to avoid getting stuck in a local minimum. The authors explain that this algorithm is inspired by the physical process of annealing, which is used to make metals stronger. When metal is heated and then cooled slowly, it becomes stronger because the atoms have time to rearrange themselves into a lower energy state.\n\nThe third algorithm discussed is the Genetic Algorithm. This algorithm is used to find the best solution to a problem by starting with a population of random solutions and then selecting the best solutions to reproduce. The new solutions are then mutated and the process is repeated. The authors explain that this algorithm is inspired by the process of natural selection. The fittest individuals are more likely to survive and reproduce, and over time, the population will become better and better at solving the problem.\n\nIn conclusion, the authors discuss how understanding the physical systems behind optimization algorithms can help us to design better algorithms.

The proposed method is based on an alternating minimization algorithm, which alternates between minimizing a PLS objective function and a regularization term. The PLS objective function is minimized using stochastic gradient descent, and the regularization term is minimized using a proximal gradient method. The proposed method is evaluated on two multiview datasets, and the results show that it outperforms existing methods for multiview representation learning."}, {"cluster_id": 8, "paper_id": "5d4b71408a79c6780c5e238c871d431504425195", "summary": "In this paper, the authors analyze the convergence of Cyclic Block Coordinate Descent (CBCD) methods for strongly convex minimization.

Introduction\n\nWith the development of intelligent transportation systems, there is an increasing demand for automatic vehicle re-identification (re-ID) in video surveillance. However, existing re-ID methods often suffer from two major problems: 1) They require a large amount of labeled data for training, which is expensive and time-consuming to collect; and 2) They usually do not work well when the training and testing data are collected from different camera views, due to the large variation in vehicle appearance across views.\n\nTo address these issues, this paper proposes a new self-supervised method for vehicle re-ID, which only requires a small amount of labeled data and can be trained on data from different camera views. The key idea is to use a generative model to learn a latent representation of vehicle images that is view-invariant. The latent representation is then used for re-ID.\n\n2. Method\n\nThe proposed method consists of two parts: 1) a self-supervised part that learns a view-invariant latent representation of vehicle images, and 2) a supervised part that uses the latent representation for re-ID.\n\nIn the self-supervised part, the authors train a generative model on a large dataset of unlabeled vehicle images. The model is designed to learn a latent representation that is view-invariant, meaning that images of the same vehicle should have similar latent representations regardless of the view. To encourage this, the model is trained to reconstruct images from different views of the same vehicle.\n\nIn the supervised part, the latent representation learned in the self-supervised part is used for re-ID. A standard re-ID model is trained on a small labeled dataset, using the latent representation as input. The model is then tested on data from different camera views, to evaluate its performance.\n\n3. Results\n\nThe authors evaluate the proposed method on two publicly available datasets: VeRi and VehicleID. The results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both datasets, especially when the training and testing data are from different camera views.\n\n4. Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, the authors propose a new self-supervised method for vehicle re-ID. The method only requires a small amount of labeled data and can be trained on data from different camera views.

Instead, it is much better to learn concepts and then apply them to new situations.\n\nThere are a number of ways to promote understanding over memorization. One is to use analogies and metaphors to explain concepts. Another is to provide opportunities for students to use what they have learned in new and creative ways. Finally, it is important to encourage students to ask questions and to think critically about the material they are learning.\n\nWhen students are able to understand concepts, they are more likely to remember them and be able to apply them to new situations.

Method\n\nOur method is based on the idea of CycleGAN, which is a method for unsupervised image-to-image translation. CycleGAN is a two-player game between a generator and a discriminator. The generator is trained to generate images from the source domain that are indistinguishable from the target domain, and the discriminator is trained to distinguish between the generated images and the real images from the target domain.\n\nIn order to adapt CycleGAN to the task of semantic segmentation, we add a new loss function that encourages the model to produce semantically consistent outputs. This loss function is based on the idea of cycle consistency, which is the property that a model should be able to translate an image from the source domain to the target domain and then back to the source domain without losing any information.\n\nWe evaluate our method on the task of adapting a model from the Cityscapes dataset to the Mapillary dataset.

Keystroke dynamics is the study of how people type on a keyboard. Behavioral biometrics is the study of people's behavioral patterns.

This is a problem because social media data is often used for research purposes, and the release of PII could jeopardize the anonymity of research participants.\n\nThe challenges associated with developing algorithms for masking PII in social media data include the fact that such data is often unstructured and contains a variety of different types of information. Additionally, social media data is often dynamic, meaning that PII that is not initially present in a dataset may be added at a later date.\n\nA number of existing algorithms have been proposed for masking PII in social media data. These include the k-anonymity and l-diversity algorithms, which are designed to protect the privacy of individual users, and the t-closeness algorithm, which is designed to protect the privacy of sensitive attributes.\n\nThe effectiveness of these algorithms varies depending on the type of data being masked.

Some people were claiming that the MMR vaccine\ncauses autism, which is not true. This misinformation made it difficult for\npeople to make an informed decision about whether or not to vaccinate their\nchildren.\n\nAnother issue was that some people who did vaccinate their children did so\nbecause they were worried about the outbreak.

The proposed approach uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) to map the raw waveform of an acoustic signal to a high-level representation, which is then used to detect speech activity. The RNN is trained using a feedback loop, where the output of the network is used to generate feedback that is used to update the network weights. The feedback loop is designed to allow the network to adapt to different types of acoustic environments, which results in improved robustness to noise and other types of distortions. The proposed approach is evaluated on a public dataset, and the results show that the feedback-driven approach outperforms the traditional approach of training a neural network on a fixed dataset."}, {"cluster_id": 16, "paper_id": "5900a66e0e015f3c8df6bc46020d47f6780997ae", "summary": "The paper explores the idea of auditory salience in natural soundscapes.

In order to make sense of all this information, the auditory system employs a number of strategies to reduce the dimensionality of the acoustic signal and to distill the relevant features for further processing. One such strategy is temporal integration, which refers to the tendency of neurons to fire more frequently in response to a sound when it is prolonged. This paper investigates the role of temporal integration in the auditory system by looking at the responses of model central auditory neurons to natural sounds.\n\nThe authors first demonstrate that their model neurons are capable of sustaining firing for the duration of a natural sound. They then show that the neurons exhibit a higher degree of firing when the sound is prolonged, and that this firing is selective for certain features of the sound. In particular, the neurons fire more frequently in response to sounds with higher levels of spectral energy, and they are more selective for certain frequencies when the sound is prolonged. This suggests that temporal integration plays a role in the auditory system's ability to extract relevant features from complex and variable sounds.\n\nThe findings of this paper contribute to our understanding of how the auditory system processes complex and variable sounds.

One area of AI that has seen significant progress is machine learning, which enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance on tasks over time. However, machine learning algorithms are often opaque, making it difficult to understand how they arrive at their predictions. This can be problematic, as it can lead to unforeseen errors.\n\nTo address this issue, researchers have begun to develop methods for making machine learning algorithms more transparent. One such method is known as \"algorithmic accountability.\" Algorithmic accountability is a framework for understanding and evaluating the decisions made by machine learning algorithms. It involves understanding the data that was used to train the algorithm, the algorithm's decision-making process, and the factors that influenced the algorithm's decisions.\n\nThe 2014 Frederick Jelinek Memorial Workshop was held to discuss the state of the art in algorithmic accountability. The workshop brought together researchers from a variety of disciplines, including machine learning, statistics, computer science, and law. The goal of the workshop was to identify challenges and opportunities for research on algorithmic accountability.\n\nThe workshop began with a keynote address by Yann LeCun, Director of AI Research at Facebook. LeCun discussed the importance of transparency in machine learning algorithms, and he highlighted some of the challenges that need to be addressed in order to make machine learning more transparent. He also discussed some of the ways in which Facebook is working to make its machine learning algorithms more transparent.\n\nFollowing the keynote address, there were three panel discussions. The first panel, which was moderated by Margaret Levi, Director of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University, focused on the question of why algorithmic accountability is important. The panelists discussed the need for transparency in machine learning algorithms, the potential benefits of algorithmic accountability, and the challenges that need to be addressed in order to make machine learning more transparent.\n\nThe second panel, which was moderated by Jack Knott, Dean of the School of Public Policy at the University of Southern California, focused on the question of how to achieve algorithmic accountability. The panelists discussed a variety of approaches, including audits, user studies, and technical analysis. They also discussed the challenges that need to be addressed in order to make machine learning more transparent.\n\nThe third panel, which was moderated by William Isaac, Professor of Law at the University of California, Berkeley, focused on the question of the legal implications of algorithmic accountability. The panelists discussed the need for transparency in machine learning algorithms, the potential benefits of algorithmic accountability, and the challenges that need to be addressed in order to make machine learning more transparent.\n\nOverall, the workshop was a success in terms of identifying challenges and opportunities for research on algorithmic accountability. The participants identified a number of challenges that need to be addressed, including the need for better methods for auditing and evaluating machine learning algorithms, the need for more user-friendly tools for understanding and interacting with machine learning algorithms, and the need for more research on the legal implications of algorithmic accountability."}, {"cluster_id": 19, "paper_id": "fd377b46522cb8d6d8a5f6dd2ea625279b61b3ee", "summary": "hari1,2,3,4,5,6,\u2217,\u2020,\u2021,\n\n1University of South Florida, 2Nvidia, 3SRI International, 4Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, 5Stanford University, 6USF Health Morsani College of Medicine\n\nDeep neural networks (DNNs) have shown great success in a variety of tasks such as image classification, object detection, and speech recognition.

Introduction The goal of acoustic modeling is to map an acoustic signal to a sequence of phonetic states. Most of the research in the past has been focused on single-stream methods, where a single feature vector is used to represent the acoustic signal. However, in many practical applications, multiple sensors are available, each providing a different view of the same phenomenon. For example, in automatic speech recognition, multiple microphones can be used to capture the speech signal from different angles. In this paper, we investigate the use of multiple streams of acoustic data for acoustic modeling. 1.2. Multi-stream Acoustic Modeling The key idea in multi-stream acoustic modeling is to use multiple feature streams, each representing a different view of the same acoustic phenomenon. For example, in automatic speech recognition, multiple microphones can be used to capture the speech signal from different angles. The different feature streams can be used to capture different aspects of the phenomenon, and the combination of the multiple streams can provide a more robust representation of the phenomenon. In this paper, we investigate the use of multiple streams of acoustic data for acoustic modeling. We first describe the Multi-Stream Neural Network (MSN), which is a neural network that can be used to learn a multi-stream acoustic model. We then describe the Multi-Stream Support Vector Machine (MSSVM), which is a support vector machine that can be used to learn a multi-stream acoustic model. Finally, we compare the performance of the MSN and MSSVM on a speech recognition task. 2. The Multi-Stream Neural Network The Multi-Stream Neural Network (MSN) is a neural network that can be used to learn a multi-stream acoustic model. The MSN is a feed-forward neural network with one hidden layer. The input to the MSN is a sequence of acoustic vectors, each representing a different view of the same acoustic phenomenon. The output of the MSN is a sequence of phonetic states. The MSN can be trained using the backpropagation algorithm. 3. The Multi-Stream Support Vector Machine The Multi-Stream Support Vector Machine (MSSVM) is a support vector machine that can be used to learn a multi-stream acoustic model. The MSSVM is a support vector machine with a linear kernel. The input to the MSSVM is a sequence of acoustic vectors, each representing a different view of the same acoustic phenomenon. The output of the MSSVM is a sequence of phonetic states. The MSSVM can be trained using the sequential minimal optimization algorithm. 4. Experiments We compared the performance of the MSN and MSSVM on a speech recognition task. The speech recognition task was the TIMIT corpus, which is a standard corpus for speech recognition. The results showed that the MSN outperformed the MSSVM on the speech recognition task. 5. Conclusion In this paper, we investigated the use of multiple streams of acoustic data for acoustic modeling.

The transducer uses a language model to score the translation hypotheses and selects the hypothesis with the highest score.

The correction for continuity is a method that is used to account for the fact that when a sample is taken from a population, the sample will not be a perfect representation of the population. The correction for continuity is a way to adjust for this so that the probabilities that are estimated from the sample are more accurate.\n\nThe paper first looks at the case where the population is a Bernoulli distribution. The correction for continuity is derived for this case, and it is shown that the correction is a function of the sample size and the success rate of the population. The paper then looks at the case where the population is a uniform distribution. In this case, the correction for continuity is a function of the sample size only. The paper then looks at the case where the population is a normal distribution. In this case, the correction for continuity is a function of the sample size and the standard deviation of the population.\n\nThe paper then looks at how the correction for continuity can be used to estimate the probability of a rare event. The paper gives an example of estimating the probability of a disease that affects only 1 in 10,000 people. The correction for continuity is used to adjust for the fact that the sample size will not be large enough to accurately estimate the probability of the disease.\n\nThe paper concludes by looking at the implications of the correction for continuity.

Introduction\n\n1.1 Background\n\nWith the advent of the Internet and the globalization of business, the need for real-time communication between people who speak different languages has increased exponentially. At the same time, the development of automatic speech recognition (ASR) and machine translation (MT) technologies has made it possible to develop systems that can automatically translate speech in real time. These systems, known as simultaneous speech translation (SST) systems, have the potential to revolutionize communication between people who speak different languages.\n\n1.2 Problem statement\n\nHowever, current SST systems have several limitations. First, they require a large amount of training data in order to achieve high accuracy. Second, they are often limited to translating between two languages. Third, they often do not take into account the context in which the speech is being translated, which can lead to errors.\n\n1.3 Objective\n\nThe objective of this paper is to develop a new SST system that overcomes these limitations. The system is based on the Transformer, a deep learning model that has been shown to be effective for ASR and MT. The Transformer is augmented with an external memory, which allows the system to store information about the context of the speech. The system is also trained on a large amount of data, which enables it to achieve high accuracy. Finally, the system is designed to be able to translate between multiple languages.\n\n2. Method\n\n2.1 Data\n\nThe data used to train the system is a dataset of English-Spanish parallel speech data. The dataset consists of over 100,000 hours of speech data, which is split into training, development, and test sets.\n\n2.2 Model\n\nThe model used is the Transformer, which is a deep learning model that has been shown to be effective for ASR and MT. The Transformer is augmented with an external memory, which allows the system to store information about the context of the speech.\n\n2.3 Training\n\nThe system is trained on the English-Spanish parallel speech data. The training data is used to train the Transformer model. The Transformer is then used to translate the speech in the development and test sets. The system is evaluated on the development and test sets.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1 Accuracy\n\nThe system achieves a translation accuracy of 96.5% on the development set and 97.0% on the test set.\n\n3.2 Fluency\n\nThe system produces fluent translations that are similar to those produced by human translators.\n\n3.3 Scalability\n\nThe system is designed to be scalable and able to translate between multiple languages.\n\n4. Conclusion\n\nThis paper has presented a new SST system that overcomes the limitations of current SST systems. The system is based on the Transformer, which is augmented with an external memory. The system is trained on a large amount of data, which enables it to achieve high accuracy.

Introduction\n\n1.1 Background\n\nDeep learning has shown great promise in various spatiotemporal learning tasks such as image classification, object detection, and activity recognition. However, most of the existing methods require a large amount of training data and computational resources, which limits their practicality. To address this issue, recent studies have proposed various methods for efficient spatiotemporal learning.\n\n1.2 Contributions\n\nIn this paper, we propose a new method for efficient spatiotemporal learning called AdaMAE. AdaMAE is an adaptation of the masked autoencoder (MAE) that uses an adaptive masking scheme to reduce the computational cost of training. The key idea is to dynamically update the masks used in the MAE during training, so that the masks only cover the relevant parts of the input data. We evaluate AdaMAE on two publicly available datasets: the KTH action dataset and the Weizmann action dataset. Our results show that AdaMAE can achieve comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods with a significantly smaller number of parameters and FLOPS (floating point operations).\n\n1.3 Paper Structure\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the related work on efficient spatiotemporal learning. In Section 3, we describe the proposed AdaMAE method in detail. In Section 4, we evaluate AdaMAE on two publicly available datasets. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 5.\n\n2. Related Work\n\n2.1 Efficient Spatiotemporal Learning\n\nThere has been a recent trend in the deep learning community towards developing methods for efficient spatiotemporal learning. The goal is to design methods that can achieve good performance with a small number of parameters and FLOPS.\n\nSome of the early work in this area focused on designing compact architectures for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). For example, the MobileNets [1] and ShuffleNets [2] architectures use depthwise separable convolutions to reduce the computational cost. More recent work has proposed methods for reducing the number of parameters and FLOPS without sacrificing performance.\n\nOne such method is pruning, which removes unnecessary parameters from the network. Pruning has been shown to be effective in reducing the number of parameters and FLOPS without sacrificing performance [3, 4, 5]. Another method is knowledge distillation, which transfers the knowledge from a large network (called the teacher network) to a smaller network (called the student network) [6, 7].\n\n3. AdaMAE Method\n\n3.1 Overview\n\nThe proposed AdaMAE method is an adaptation of the masked autoencoder (MAE) [8] that uses an adaptive masking scheme to reduce the computational cost of training. The key idea is to dynamically update the masks used in the MAE during training, so that the masks only cover the relevant parts of the input data.\n\n3.2 Masked Autoencoder\n\nThe MAE is a type of autoencoder [9] that uses masks to selectively ignore parts of the input data. The masks are typically generated randomly and are fixed during training. The use of masks allows the MAE to focus on the relevant parts of the input data and to ignore the irrelevant parts. This results in a more efficient training process and a smaller network.\n\n3.3 AdaMAE\n\nThe AdaMAE method is an adaptation of the MAE that uses an adaptive masking scheme to reduce the computational cost of training. The key idea is to dynamically update the masks used in the MAE during training, so that the masks only cover the relevant parts of the input data.\n\nThe AdaMAE method works as follows. First, the masks are generated randomly and are fixed during the initial phase of training. Second, the masks are updated dynamically during the second phase of training. The updates are based on the gradients of the error with respect to the input data. The masks are updated so that they only cover the relevant parts of the input data. This results in a more efficient training process and a smaller network.\n\n3.4 Implementation\n\nThe AdaMAE method was implemented in TensorFlow [10]. The code is available at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/contrib/adamae.\n\n4. Evaluation\n\n4.1 Datasets\n\nThe AdaMAE method was evaluated on two publicly available datasets: the KTH action dataset [11] and the Weizmann action dataset [12]. The KTH action dataset contains six action categories: walking, jogging, running, boxing, handclapping, and handwaving. The Weizmann action dataset contains ten action categories: running, jumping, waving, clapping, bending, and jumping jack.\n\n4.2 Metrics\n\nThe performance of the AdaMAE method was evaluated using the following metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\n\n4.3 Results\n\nThe results of the evaluation are shown in Table 1. The AdaMAE method achieved comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods with a significantly smaller number of parameters and FLOPS.\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we proposed a new method for efficient spatiotemporal learning called AdaMAE. AdaMAE is an adaptation of the masked autoencoder (MAE) that uses an adaptive masking scheme to reduce the computational cost of training. The key idea is to dynamically update the masks used in the MAE during training, so that the masks only cover the relevant parts of the input data.

Introduction\n\n1.1 Problem Formulation\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in using deep learning for medical image segmentation. However, training deep learning models requires a large amount of data, which is often unavailable in a single institution.

To address this challenge, we propose to use a set of priors that are shared by the two domains. These priors can be used to align the two domains, making it possible to directly apply the model trained on the source domain to the target domain.\n\n1.3.

Introduction\n\n1.1 Background\n\nCrowd counting is an important and challenging problem in computer vision. It has a wide range of applications, such as public safety, event management, and traffic control.\n\n1.2 Problem statement\n\nThe problem of crowd counting is challenging for several reasons. First, the density of people in a crowd can vary greatly, making it difficult to estimate the number of people in an image. Second, people can be occluded by each other or by objects in the scene, making it difficult to detect them. Finally, people can be in different positions and orientations, making it difficult to count them accurately.\n\n1.3 Contributions\n\nIn this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Attention-based Crowd Counting Network (HA-CCN), which is a deep learning-based approach to crowd counting. The proposed network consists of two parts: a feature extraction network and a counting network. The feature extraction network is based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and is used to extract features from an input image. The counting network is based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) network and is used to count the number of people in the image.\n\nThe proposed HA-CCN has several advantages. First, the deep CNN can extract high-level features from the input image, which are then used by the LSTM network to count the number of people. Second, the LSTM network can learn the temporal dependencies between the extracted features, which is important for counting people in a crowd. Third, the hierarchical structure of the HA-CCN allows it to count people in different density levels, which is important for accurate crowd counting.\n\n1.4 Paper organization\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review related work on crowd counting. In Section 3, we describe the proposed HA-CCN in detail. In Section 4, we present the experimental results. Finally, in Section 5, we conclude the paper.\n\n2. Related work\n\n2.1 Crowd counting\n\nCrowd counting is a challenging problem in computer vision. Early methods for crowd counting relied on hand-crafted features and traditional machine learning methods, such as support vector machines (SVMs) [1], [2], [3]. These methods were limited by the hand-crafted features and the lack of large-scale datasets.\n\nWith the advent of deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used for crowd counting [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. These methods typically use a regression-based approach, where the CNN is used to map an input image to a density map. The density map is then used to estimate the number of people in the image.\n\nRecently, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been used for crowd counting [9], [10], [11], [12]. These methods typically use an RNN to map an input sequence of density maps to a count. The RNN can learn the temporal dependencies between the density maps, which is important for accurate crowd counting.\n\n2.2 Hierarchical attention\n\nHierarchical attention is a neural network architecture that has been used for various tasks, such as text classification [13], [14], [15], image captioning [16], [17], and video classification [18], [19], [20]. In the context of crowd counting, hierarchical attention has been used in [21], [22], [23], [24].\n\n3. Proposed method\n\n3.1 HA-CCN overview\n\nThe proposed HA-CCN is a deep learning-based approach to crowd counting. The network consists of two parts: a feature extraction network and a counting network. The feature extraction network is based on a deep CNN and is used to extract features from an input image. The counting network is based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) network and is used to count the number of people in the image.\n\n3.2 Feature extraction network\n\nThe feature extraction network is based on the VGG-16 [25] deep CNN. The VGG-16 network is composed of 16 layers, including 13 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers. We use the pre-trained VGG-16 network and fine-tune it for crowd counting.\n\nThe input to the network is an image of size 224\u00d7224. The output of the network is a feature map of size 7\u00d77. The feature map is then fed into the counting network.\n\n3.3 Counting network\n\nThe counting network is based on the LSTM [26] network. The LSTM network is composed of an input layer, an output layer, and a hidden layer. The hidden layer contains LSTM cells.\n\nThe input to the network is the feature map from the feature extraction network. The output of the network is the count of the number of people in the image.\n\n3.4 Training\n\nThe HA-CCN is trained using the Adam [27] optimizer. The objective function is the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted count and the ground truth count.\n\n4. Experimental results\n\n4.1Datasets\n\nWe evaluate the proposed HA-CCN on three publicly available datasets: the Mall dataset [28], the UCF-QNRF dataset [29], and the WorldExpo\u201910 dataset [30].\n\nThe Mall dataset contains 2000 images of a mall. The images were collected over two days, with different crowd densities. The UCF-QNRF dataset contains 1237 images of different crowd scenes. The WorldExpo\u201910 dataset contains 3980 images of the World Expo 2010 in Shanghai.\n\n4.2 Evaluation metrics\n\nWe use the mean absolute error (MAE) and the mean squared error (MSE) to evaluate the performance of the proposed HA-CCN. The MAE is the average absolute difference between the predicted count and the ground truth count. The MSE is the average squared difference between the predicted count and the ground truth count.\n\n4.3 Results\n\nTable 1 shows the results of the proposed HA-CCN on the three datasets. The HA-CCN achieves the best performance on the Mall dataset, with an MAE of 12.4 and an MSE of 193.4. The HA-CCN also achieves good performance on the UCF-QNRF dataset, with an MAE of 27.2 and an MSE of 556.4. On the WorldExpo\u201910 dataset, the HA-CCN achieves an MAE of 43.1 and an MSE of 1552.1.\n\n5.

The pyramid network is designed to extract features of different scales from an input image, while the dehazing network is designed to estimate the transmission map and recover the clear image. The two networks are trained jointly to end-to-end.

One way to do this is to use paraphrasing. Paraphrasing is the process of rewriting a text in a different way while keeping the original meaning.

The method is based on a representation of the translation space, which is a space that contains all possible translations of a text. The translation space is represented as a graph, where each node represents a possible translation, and the edges represent the relationships between the translations. The paraphrases are generated by traversing the graph from the original translation to the target translation. The paraphrases are then evaluated by a machine translation system.

NMT can be used to translate multiple languages pairs, but research has shown that it is not always accurate.\n\nOne issue that NMT systems face is the use of placeholders, which are words or phrases that are used to represent other words or concepts that cannot be directly translated. For example, the English word \"I\" can be translated to the Spanish word \"yo\", but the Spanish word \"yo\" cannot be translated to the English word \"I\". This is because the Spanish word \"yo\" is a placeholder for the speaker, and the English word \"I\" is a placeholder for the listener.\n\nPlaceholders can also be used to represent concepts that do not have a direct translation. For example, the English word \"love\" can be translated to the Spanish word \"amor\", but the Spanish word \"amor\" cannot be translated to the English word \"love\". This is because the Spanish word \"amor\" is a placeholder for the concept of love, and the English word \"love\" is a placeholder for the concept of affection.\n\nThe use of placeholders can cause problems for NMT systems, as they can lead to inaccuracies in the translation. In order to address this issue, researchers have proposed a number of methods for dealing with placeholders.\n\nThe first method is to use a placeholder dictionary, which is a list of words and their translations. This dictionary can be used to look up the translations of words that are not directly translated.\n\nThe second method is to use a bilingual lexicon, which is a list of words and their translations in both languages. This lexicon can be used to look up the translations of words that are not directly translated.\n\nThe third method is to use a neural network to learn the translations of words that are not directly translated. This method is known as transfer learning.\n\nThe fourth method is to use a human translator to provide the translations of words that are not directly translated.\n\nThe fifth method is to use a machine translation system that is designed specifically for translating placeholders. This method is known as domain adaptation.\n\nDomain adaptation is the most effective method for dealing with placeholders, as it can learn the translations of words that are not directly translated. However, this method is not always available, and the other methods can be used to improve the accuracy of NMT systems."}, {"cluster_id": 14, "paper_id": "89e0504b68ace8bd3c71e9113de51a29702dcdb7", "summary": "In this paper, the authors propose a method for creating large-scale, diverse, paraphrastic bitexts.

We find that state-of-the-art models struggle with this task, making errors even on simple cases of temporal reasoning. We also find that existing models do not benefit from temporal information that is made explicit in the text, such as temporal connectives.

A frame is a schematic representation of a situation, and the roles in a frame are the positions that need to be filled in order for the frame to be complete. For example, the frame for a simple transaction might include roles such as buyer, seller, and item.\n\nThe authors argue that there are a small number of basic frames that are used to understand the world, and that words can be categorized according to the frames they are associated with. They identify six major frame categories: objects, events, states, processes, relations, and locations. Within each category, there are a number of subcategories. For example, the category of events includes subcategories such as actions, changes, and movements.\n\nThe authors claim that their approach can be used to understand the meanings of words that have multiple senses. For example, the word \"run\" can be used to refer to a type of movement (e.g. running away from something) or a type of event (e.g. a race). However, these different senses of \"run\" can be understood in terms of the different frames they are associated with. \"Run\" can be associated with the frame for movement, which includes roles such as mover and destination, or the frame for an event, which includes roles such as participants and outcome.\n\nThe authors conclude by discussing some of the benefits of their approach, such as its ability to deal with polysemy and to provide a principled way of understanding the meanings of words."}, {"cluster_id": 1, "paper_id": "d987124b5b616f2958eaf0e27da0353c459d9037", "summary": "The paper presents a method for learning to predict script events from domain-specific text.

Commonsense knowledge is defined as the \"knowledge of everyday life that we all take for granted\" (p. 3). It is the kind of knowledge that allows us to make inferences and predictions about the world around us.\n\nThe importance of commonsense knowledge is that it allows us to fill in the gaps when we do not have complete information. For example, if we see a person walking down the street, we can make a number of inferences about that person based on our commonsense knowledge. We might infer that the person is going to a nearby store, or that the person is carrying a heavy load.\n\nOne of the challenges in artificial intelligence is that computers do not have access to the same kind of commonsense knowledge that humans do. As a result, they are often not able to make the same kind of inferences and predictions. This can be a major limitation in their ability to understand and interact with the world around them.\n\nThere are a number of ways in which researchers are trying to address this problem.

This paper proposed a simple data mixing prior that can be used to improve self-supervised learning. The prior is based on the idea that data should be mixed in a way that is consistent with the task that the model is trying to learn. For example, if the model is trying to learn to colorize an image, the data should be mixed so that the model is exposed to different colors and different types of images.

They point out that most datasets are imbalanced, with a much smaller number of positive examples than negative examples. This can lead to problems in learning, as the classifier may focus on the negative examples and ignore the positive examples. Re-sampling methods attempt to address this issue by resampling the data so that the classifier sees a more balanced set of examples.\n\nHowever, the authors argue that re-sampling can actually hurt performance in semi-supervised settings.

This can lead to a situation where the classifier has difficulty generalizing from the training data to the test data.\n\nThe authors propose a new method, called SER, which they claim overcomes these problems. SER works by first creating a balanced set of training data, and then using this data to train a self-ensemble.

Introduction\n\n1.1.Motivation\n\nWith the rapid development of medical image acquisition and processing technologies, there is an increasing demand for automated medical image segmentation methods. However, most existing methods require manual design of the segmentation network architecture, which is a time-consuming and expertise-demanding process.\n\n1.2.Contributions\n\nIn this paper, the authors propose a novel approach for automated medical image segmentation, which they call V-NAS. The key idea of V-NAS is to search for the optimal segmentation network architecture directly from data. To this end, they formulate the segmentation task as a black-box optimization problem and use a reinforcement learning-based approach to search for the optimal network architecture.\n\n1.3.Method\n\nThe V-NAS method consists of three main stages: 1) a pre-training stage, 2) a network architecture search stage, and 3) a fine-tuning stage.\n\nIn the pre-training stage, the authors first train a segmentation network with a randomly initialized architecture on a large dataset. This network is then used as a guide network to generate a synthetic dataset, which is then used to train a second segmentation network with a fixed architecture.\n\nIn the network architecture search stage, the authors use a reinforcement learning-based approach to search for the optimal segmentation network architecture. The search is performed on a validation set, and the goal is to find the architecture that achieves the best performance on the validation set.\n\nIn the fine-tuning stage, the authors fine-tune the segmentation network with the optimal architecture on the training set. This network is then used to segment new images.\n\n2. Experiments\n\n2.1.Datasets and Evaluation Metrics\n\nThe authors evaluate the V-NAS method on two publicly available medical image segmentation datasets: the BraTS dataset and the ISLES dataset. For the BraTS dataset, the authors use the mean Dice score as the evaluation metric. For the ISLES dataset, the authors use the mean Jaccard score as the evaluation metric.\n\n2.2.Results\n\nThe authors find that the V-NAS method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both the BraTS and ISLES datasets. In particular, on the BraTS dataset, the V-NAS method achieves a mean Dice score of 0.943, which is significantly better than the state-of-the-art mean Dice score of 0.937. On the ISLES dataset, the V-NAS method achieves a mean Jaccard score of 0.857, which is significantly better than the state-of-the-art mean Jaccard score of 0.842.\n\n3.

Machine translation quality is important because it can impact the usability and effectiveness of machine translation systems.

Introduction\n\nWith the advent of deep learning, semantic segmentation has achieved great success in many computer vision tasks. However, most of the existing methods require a large amount of labeled data for training, which is expensive and time-consuming to obtain. Domain adaptation has been proposed as a solution to this problem, by transferring knowledge from a source domain with plenty of labeled data to a target domain with only few labels.\n\nMost of the existing domain adaptation methods for semantic segmentation focus on unsupervised methods, which are not effective in the case of videos since they do not take into account the temporal information. In this paper, the authors propose a spatio-temporal pixel-level contrastive learning method for video semantic segmentation, which is effective in the case of videos since it takes into account both spatial and temporal information.\n\n2. Method\n\nThe proposed method consists of two main components: a source encoder and a target encoder. The source encoder is trained on the source domain data with supervision, while the target encoder is trained on the target domain data without supervision.\n\nThe two encoders are then used to extract features from the input images. The features from the two encoders are then fed into a contrastive loss function, which encourages the features from the two encoders to be similar for the same input and dissimilar for different inputs. This encourages the two encoders to learn a common feature representation that is effective for the task of semantic segmentation.\n\n3. Experiments\n\nThe proposed method was evaluated on two benchmark datasets: Cityscapes and CamVid. The results showed that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods by a significant margin, especially in the case of videos.\n\n4.

The paper evaluates the performance of the algorithm on a test set of use-cases and shows that it is able to accurately extract the relevant information."}, {"cluster_id": 5, "paper_id": "0380a40df2833b48c509af21ada2e755300d8389", "summary": "The paper presents a study on the extraction of mobility-related information from clinical notes. The study is divided into three parts: entity hierarchy, corpus annotation, and sequence labeling.\n\nIn the first part, the authors develop a hierarchical entity model for mobility-related information. The model consists of four levels: entity, event, activity, and context. The entity level contains information about the patient, the event level contains information about the mobility event, the activity level contains information about the activity performed during the event, and the context level contains information about the context in which the event occurred.\n\nIn the second part, the authors annotate a corpus of clinical notes with the entity model. The corpus consists of notes from two sources: the MIMIC-III database and the eICU database. The annotation process is divided into two steps: manual annotation and automatic annotation. In the manual annotation step, a set of rules is used to annotate the entities in the clinical notes. In the automatic annotation step, a machine learning algorithm is used to annotate the entities in the clinical notes.\n\nIn the third part, the authors develop a sequence labeling model for the entity hierarchy. The model is based on a recurrent neural network and is trained on the annotated corpus. The model is used to label the entities in the clinical notes."}, {"cluster_id": 15, "paper_id": "302c5388dfc37671ce109d65349a3c8cf0746788", "summary": "In this paper, the authors propose a new approach to matrix factorization that results in more interpretable feature-selecting representations. This is accomplished by using a sparse encoding for the latent factors, which encourages the selection of only a few features for each latent factor. This results in a more parsimonious model that is easier to interpret. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of their approach on several real-world datasets."}, {"cluster_id": 19, "paper_id": "44320d1187c34e5ec83b4c8c2772e8baae3a653a", "summary": "The paper discusses the experiences and challenges of manually annotating functioning information in medical records. The authors describe the process they used to manually annotate the records, including the use of a coding manual and a web-based interface. They discuss the challenges they encountered, including the need for expert knowledge of the domain, the difficulty of dealing with missing data, and the time-consuming nature of the task. They also describe the benefits of the process, including the ability to improve the quality of the data and the ability to add new functionality to the system."}, {"cluster_id": 5, "paper_id": "5389f218e7a90abae546b956f60d1dc1326a0f52", "summary": "Extraction\n\nThe paper discusses the need for annotated corpora in order to train and test information extraction systems. The authors argue that there is a lack of high-quality, domain-specific annotated corpora. To address this issue, they propose a method for curating annotated corpora. The method involves four steps: (1) identifying relevant documents, (2) selecting a set of annotations, (3) creating the annotations, and (4) verifying the annotations. The authors evaluate their method by curating a corpus of medical abstracts. They find that their method is effective in curating high-quality, domain-specific annotated corpora."}, {"cluster_id": 10, "paper_id": "753e334622e09613c438eb6410e83d40a01a6041", "summary": "The U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) provides federal disability benefits to eligible individuals. The determination of benefits is a complex process that involves review of medical and vocational evidence, as well as an assessment of the claimant's residual functional capacity (RFC). The SSA has developed a natural language processing (NLP) tool, the Disability Determination Service Toolkit (DSTK), to support the determination of benefits. The DSTK includes a set of NLP tools that have been specifically designed to support the extraction of information from medical records. The toolkit includes a named entity recognition tool, a tool for extracting information about claimant's functional limitations, and a tool for extracting information about claimant's work history. The DSTK has been used in production since 2016 and has been shown to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the disability determination process."}, {"cluster_id": 0, "paper_id": "e38e5957a05b5bd21f7d18a41a56d15e6549d3c7", "summary": "In this paper, the authors analyze ambiguity in medical concept normalization in electronic health record (EHR) datasets. They identify three types of ambiguity - lexical, syntactic, and semantic - and provide a coverage analysis of each type. They find that lexical ambiguity is the most common, followed by syntactic and semantic ambiguity. They also find that the majority of ambiguous concepts are normalized to a single concept, with a smaller number of concepts normalized to multiple concepts."}, {"cluster_id": 12, "paper_id": "fa3f06c40a7c0904ecb5ad0d79d40ccaa99b377b", "summary": "The paper describes the process of building a clinical document corpus called Angelfish. The authors use a variety of methods to collect and label data, including manual annotation and natural language processing.
